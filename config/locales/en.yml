    smart-decision: "We Help You Make Smart Decisions"
    smart-decision-p1: "Accounting and finance are the languages of business, making critical decisions and communicating major information about the business. Imagine having a wrong single digit on the report- it could lead your business to have detrimental consequences."
    smart-decision-p2: "Keeping your business on the right path starts with making the right hiring decision. Numbers do lie, as they are truthful as the finance professionals report the numbers to be."
    smart-decision-p3: "In hiring, we ensure our talents to have three things in mind — accuracy, confidentiality, and ethics."
    accuracy-confidentiality-ethics: "Accuracy, Confidentiality, and Ethics"
    accuracy-confidentiality-ethics-p1: "Hiring someone with a strong sense of ethics is serious and critical in accounting and finance."
    accuracy-confidentiality-ethics-p2: "So how do you measure one's ethical behavior?"
    accuracy-confidentiality-ethics-p3: "Depending on the position we utilize:"

    accuracy: "Accuracy"
    accuracy-p1: "Do you believe in numbers? The numbers in the financial data are only true as finance professionals interpret and report them to be. You need an expert who can measure candidates' level of accuracy without asking “do you care about accuracy?”"
    accuracy-p2: "If you get a question like “where do I report this expense?”, you should begin measuring the candidates' level of accuracy."
    confidentiality: "Confidentiality"
    confidentiality-p1: "Confidentiality is a serious task in the line of accounting and finance. We assess whether our candidates have the right behavioral type to handle a wide range of privileged and sensitive data in their daily tasks."
    confidentiality-p2: "With the DISC Assessment and Keirsey Temperament test, you will identify their personality types and initiate to measure their level of care for accuracy."
    confidentiality-p3: "Depending on position, our talents go through a criminal background check, SAM search record, OIG exclusion, and credit check."
    confidentiality-p4: "However, no test works better than observation. The best way to measure candidates' ethical standards is to observe the result of their actions."
    ethics: "Ethics"
    ethics-p1: "After years of researching numerous interview questions, we have developed proven interview questions. We learned that candidates' ethical behavior can be measured by a series of questions."
    ethics-p2: "For example, candidates are asked to answer a lead-in question, “Tell me about a project that you were in charge of and that required attention to details?"
    ethics-p3: "In their responses, we look for the sensitivity of the details without revealing. We seek elaboration in their story and analyze a degree of attention to detail that is required."
