          %b INFORMATION WE COLLECT
        %p
          We collect information about you to provide our services. In order for us to best provide our services to you (and to help make it feasible
          for us to do so), it is essential that we are able to collect and use the information as described in this Policy. This means that the data 
          collection is largely necessary for fulfilling the relationship we have with you, and where that is not the case, we have a legitimate 
          interest in collecting the information described below.
        
        %p
          Joynus collects information from and regarding individuals in a variety of ways from a variety of sources. Joynus initially collects information 
          from users of its website during their visits to the website. We may also collect information externally from this website, such as information
          regarding those job seekers who secure employment with or through Joynus and those employers who are or become clients of Joynus. This information 
          enables us to profile the interests of employers and job seekers, post and solicit applications for job openings and orders and track the status of
          pending openings.
          
        %p
          We sometimes afford job seekers and employers an opportunity to provide us with specific additional information when they enroll on this 
          website and complete their profile, such as their physical geographical location. Providing this information is optional. However, providing
          this information helps us better serve job seekers, employers and other website visitors by including their preferences and choices on 
          various options.
        %p
          Joynus also collects and uses information by installing small computer files (known as cookies) on the hard drive of each computer used to visit our website.
          A cookie is a string of information sent by a website and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. Cookies are an important 
          element of your experience on our website. They allow us to welcome you each time you visit and customize our information to your past website experiences.
          Cookies also help us detect and stop fraud. 
        %p
          The website may include first-party cookies (i.e., cookies that send data directly to Joynus and agents and contractors acting on behalf of Joynus, used to 
          monitor, analyze and administer the website) and third-party cookies (i.e., cookies that send data to our contractors for their commercial use). The cookies
          on our website may also track Internet activities across different websites.
          
        %p
          Some computer browsers permit you to disable or uninstall cookies, and you may do so by following the instructions provided by your hardware and software
          vendors. Joynus does not provide the means for you to opt out of having cookies placed on your computer, and makes no representation or warranty that the 
          disabling devices provided by your hardware and software vendors will be effective to block or remove the cookies. However, disabling or uninstalling these
          cookies will adversely impact the user experience on the Joynus website and may prevent you from accessing and using certain features of the website.
        
        %p
          Joynus and the vendor hosting this website collect traffic data regarding this website, and such data collection activities may involve interaction with 
          cookies, the collection of user IP addresses and the exchange of numeric codes used to identify a computer. Your computer's IP address is not necessarily 
          linked to your personally identifiable information, but does distinguish your computer from other computers that access the Joynus website. Joynus may use
          traffic data and your computer's IP address to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends, administer its website, serve more relevant 
          advertising via Google's advertising network and for other purposes. Joynus may also use your computer's IP address to identify you as a distinct, 
          though anonymous, visitor, for whom the experience may be personalized during future visits.

          %b  INFORMATION WE USE
        %p
          Joynus uses each registered job seeker's personal information to administer the various services opted for by the job seeker and to make the job seeker aware 
          of career opportunities and other developments from time to time. Personal data is information which can be used to identify you, such as name, date of birth, 
          identification number or other factors specific to your identity, such as address, telephone, email or cell/mobile number. 
        
        %p
          The user information that Joynus collects may be added to our databases and used for business purposes, including for marketing and promotional purposes,
          for a statistical analysis of users’ behavior, for product development, for content improvement, or to customize the content and layout of the website. 
          In addition, Joynus will, on occasion, send emails to you about job information you requested from the website or third-party products. If you do not want 
          to receive email from us, visit the “Opt Out” or “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any Joynus email to remove yourself from continued receipt of such
          email messages.  
        
        %p
          Among other uses, Joynus uses the information to identify an individual as a registered job seeker, to present potential employment opportunities to the 
          job seeker, to present the job seeker to potential employers and to report these transactions to the relevant job seeker. We also give each job seeker the
          option to receive certain targeted communications from time to time.

          %b  INFORMATION WE SHARE
        %p
          With the job seeker's permission, Joynus may submit the job seeker's resume, application and/or other information to a prospective employer on the basis 
          that such prospective employer will not disclose the fact that such job seeker is seeking employment or communicate with any other person regarding the 
          contents of such job seeker's resume or application except with the job seeker's consent or otherwise in compliance with applicable labor and employment laws.
          
        %p
          Joynus may also from time to time submit the job seeker's profile, with sufficient information removed so that the job seeker is not readily personally 
          identifiable, to prospective employers to solicit their potential interest in him or her as a job candidate. 
        
        %p
          Joynus may share a job seeker's personal information with entities with whom it contracts to assist in administering the website, including the job board on 
          the website, from time to time. We may also share user information with third party companies and individuals with whom we contract in connection with the 
          following: to facilitate the website; to provide the website or portions of the website on our behalf; to perform related services, including without 
          limitation, maintenance services, database management, fulfillment, web analytics and improvement of the features or functionality of the website.  
        
        %p
          Joynus may also share a job seeker's personal information with business partners to offer you goods, services and other incentives relating to the website 
          and the job board. Once we establish and maintain an employment, staffing or placement relationship with you, we use the data you provided to us to comply with
          laws and regulations, including but not limited to employment law, tax and social security and national and international sanctions regulation compliance. 
          For the purposes mentioned above, Joynus may transfer your personal data to other Joynus entities that provide services on behalf of Joynus. 
        
        %p
          We may also share your information with any successor or assign some or all of the relevant part of our business, whether through a sale of our business, merger or otherwise.
      
        %p
          We may share user information with appropriate third parties when we believe, in our sole discretion, that such sharing is appropriate: to comply with the 
          law, including but not limited to, in response to a subpoena served on Joynus; to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy or other applicable terms, rules or 
          policies; to protect the rights, property or safety of Joynus, our users or others; or to prevent activity that we believe, in our sole discretion, may be 
          or may become illegal, unethical or legally actionable (including exchanging user information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection).
          
        %p
          In all cases in which we share a job seeker's personal information, we will seek contractual commitments from the party with whom we share such information 
          to abide by the same terms and conditions as those applicable to us in this Privacy Policy regarding the use, sharing, retention, care and disposal of such 
          information.
